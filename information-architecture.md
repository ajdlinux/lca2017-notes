Sorting out the mess: how information architecture can help
===========================================================

What is IA?
-----------

* Structural design of information objects
* Creation of a structure for content
* Talked about a lot in UX field etc, but it can be applied anywhere where information is categorised or arranged

Why is IA important?
--------------------

* There's so much information out there and many ways of interacting with it
* IA addressing the issue of making information findable
* Define/implement structures depending on mode of delivery
* Information is subjective rather than objective

Factors impacting IA design
---------------------------

* Context, content, users
* Context - organisational elements, business processes, culture, etc
* Content - the data and metadata...
* Users - they have particular information needs and behaviours - e.g. cloud operators will be looking for information in the heat of a situation where they need a solution to a particular problem

User research
-------------

* Understand who the user is
* Try not to make assumptions about who the user is
* Obviously dependent on time/resources
* Existing sources of information - search logs, analytics, support tickets, customer feedback
* Techniques - interviews, observation method, surveys
* Pick the technique based on what you actually want to achieve. e.g. benefit of interview - you can get in depth information about a user on a particular subject
* Useful to use observation method to validate what's been said in interviews
* Surveys - use open ended questions to capture more information. Use incentives to improve response rate

Content analysis
----------------

* Important to assess content on a regular basis for current-ness and relevance
* Content inventory
* Content audit - set criteria to assess content (e.g. editorial, style guide, appropriateness for audience)

Designing IA
------------
* Collate research data, business goals, content
* Draft topics and high level groupings
* Check that it suits users, and refine
* Get users and stakeholders to review and provide feedback

OpenStack example
-----------------

* Initial version - high level grouping by OpenStack components
* After feedback, flipped it around to organise by operational processes

IA Testing
----------

* Card sorting
* Tree testing - creating questions and scenarios to figure out where a user would find a particular piece of information

Redis example
-------------

* Commands listed as cards, ordered alphabetically, with short description - if they're fairly familiar with the commands they can quickly find the command they want
* Alternatively there is a search field to find specific commands
* Alternatively if they're less familiar with commands, they can be filtered by group

Valve example
-------------

* Valve new employee handbook
* Ordered by topic and chronologically
