I am your user, why do you hate me?
===================================

* Donna Benjamin (@kattekrab)

* F/OSS suffers from poor usability

* a) we struggle with using open source software, b) our developer friends talk about users with contempt

* What do we mean when we talk about users? Wikipedia: A user is a person who uses a computer or network service - without the technical expertise. We're defining users by what they are *not*. We are making some assumptions about them.

* The other profession that uses the term "user" - drug dealers!

* How do we hate our users?

* Just for braniac me - A lot of free software is made by me, for me - I don't care about usability so long as it does what I need. If you need it to do more... patches welcome? Scratching my own itch.

* Stupid users meme.

* We know better than users. They don't know what they want.

* "You're just not technical" - do you really need to know how a car works just in order to drive it? What does it even mean?

* We talk about users as abstract, faceless icons. They're not really people - they're not *us*.

* Prickly attitudes.

* Users can be whiney, entitled and demanding. There are a lot more of them than there are of us. They can be incredibly entitled and opinionated, and not very helpful or polite. (Another definition of "user": the kind of person we don't want as a friend) But *why* are they whiney, entitled and demanding?

* We don't always make it easy for users to help themselves - poor documentation! "Just read the source!"

* Chat - Slack, the IRC killer! IRC has been with us for over 30 years, and is critical to the open source community - but it's not very usable. Slack came along and made something very easy and some open source projects moved over - to much flak. Slack isn't Free Software. Yet there's still plenty of people moving over to it. IRC has too many steps for people to get going. Slack does not. What can we learn from Slack's approach?

* Steep learning curves - communities take some perverse joy in being difficult to use to being with - a hazing ritual! There's something wrong when we take pride in being harder to use than other things. See the Unix editor wars...

* Kathy Sierra's "Kick Ass Curve" - crossing the "suck threshold" (How soon do they stop hating it) to the "Passion Threshold" (advocating for the software - and possibly crossing over to being a contributor!)

* "People don't want to be badass at using your tool. They want to be badass at what using your tool *allows them to do.*"

* We value perfection - and we sometimes focus on that to the exclusion of other things. The perfect is the enemy of the good.

* The cost of all of this. New contributors coming in and being driven away by existing *serious* developers. These new contributors could well be your future leaders. The risk we take by not paying attention to onboarding, documentation, helping people get over the "suck threshold" is significant. How many people have we lost who we don't even know about?

* Diversity - Genevieve Bell at Intel found a lot of women are early adopters of technology, and you get technology "ghettos" populated primarily by women - think typists, switchboard operators, and so on, and to some degree they're lost to history. Embracing our users in their full diversity and making it easy to contribute, valuing their contributions in triage and testing - we'd solve our diversity problems quickly if we did that.

* Understand who your users are; see them as people. Let's stop talking about them as users, they're *people who are using our software*. Technology is made by and for human beings. We need to think about taking care of maintainers - and caring, respecting, being empathetic towards our users.

Questions
---------

* I like your point that we need to personify and individualise the users - do you think user stories in interfaces have helped? Sometimes I read those stories from some projects and think this looks more like a myth, a story devs have told themselves that doesn't exist. A: General move in UI/UX to develop personas as a way of thinking is a good thing in general, but they're also a placeholder for real humans. User stories/user centred design is a great improvement, proprietary software is making advances here, but can also be used very, very badly - poor sketches that become dogma. They're used badly, but still a step overall in the right direction.

* In both open and closed source development, often a tension between having so many person-hours to do work, shiny features that someone wants to implement vs improving user experience. Techniques/tricks to nudge that? A: We need to embrace usability and a user-focused approach as a baseline gate for everything. This is part of the definition of "done" - that we have testing and research up front. Could we just make things easier by removing complexity? Simple is the hardest thing to do. Building that new shiny feature shouldn't happen at cost of usability

* Should something fail code review if the usability sucks? A: If we don't care to begin with - then no. But if we do care, then yes, we should. Usability should be part of that code review.

* Trying to get more users to become contributors - any good examples/strategies you've seen? A: Drupal supports mentors holding first patch workshops at conferences. Nadia also touched on this - what about the second patch? What about the tenth? Remove as much pain from that first contribution. Value it. There are some projects who do this really, really well.

* How do we attract more UX, user research, etc people to open source projects? A question I can't really answer. I don't have enough broad experience across open source communities. Drupal community struggles with getting diverse kinds of skills - we get developers, but we could do with more UX and designers, accessibility people, etc. Cultural issues with people in other professions who don't really have the same culture of sharing.

* As well as individualising, we can learn a lot by remembering people don't just exist at one point, but over a whole spectrum as they use the product, and a whole bunch of other dimensions. What are the axes that you think of when you think of the different dimensions of users? A: Humanity comes in all shapes and sizes. When we reduce users to stupid or just on a point on a continuum on our tool - we forget that they may be experts in other things who don't have any time to waste on fixing our tool. This reductionist stuff is so problematic. Different cognitive levels, assistive technologies, etc, a whole lot of different factors - age, language... so many assumptions we make.

* Do you think the previous point is about not having enough respect for other disciplines - we don't appreciate how hard it is to teach children, or practice law, or whatever, and we don't understand them? A: Yes.

* As a user, how do I approach a developer without offending them to tell them to make their product more user friendly? A: Rather than saying this really sucks, "here's a way you could make it better" - come up with a better solution. But sometimes you struggle with that - sometimes you don't know how to make it better. That's where empathy and triage comes in.

* Usability takes a lot of work to build in, it's very easy to damage. How do we resist change for change's sake? A: I don't know. I feel in open source it's both hard and we also don't care. I also think there's something we need to address about that. LCA 2007, the Sydney team developed the Zookeepr conference system. The following year, I was on the team and we set it up... where's the admin page? Where's the documentation? Oh, there's a text file and some SQL scripts. We built a page to execute those scripts and wrote documentation. The people who first wrote it wrote it only for themselves, which is fine - but then more people needed to use it. Drupal has expanded to millions of users with many skill sets, not all programmers.
