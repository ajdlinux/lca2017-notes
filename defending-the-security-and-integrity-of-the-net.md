Defending the Security and Integrity of the 'Net - is Open Source helping?
==========================================================================

* George Fong (@mongrel43)

* The Trump era is a very interesting time for policy people...

* 2017 - the year of security, privacy and integrity. These concepts are at the forefront of the issues facing the internet and technical communities this year. This is in spite of, not because of, government dictates. The community has indeed been fighting the government on data retention, site blocking, risk to our stakeholders.

* LCA 2016 - I gave a talk, "The cavalry isn't coming - we are the cavalry, act accordingly". It's even more the case now. We have to protect the stakeholders - the whole planet.

* Open access to the internet is a fundamental tenet of the Internet Society, the internet needs to be an open global resource. But accessible on what basis? Secure, private, trusted.

* The Internet community has criticised government interception

* Trust is fundamental. Trust is the byproduct of integrity. How do you find the balance when the government is supposed to be fighting terrorism or whatever? Work with government to try and sort the mess out as much as you can. No point trying to explain to a parliamentary committee the technical aspects of why data retention is bad.

* Government doesn't understand the technical issues - "you have to encrypt the data" "encrypt it to what standard?" - one reading of the data retention rules would be that data must be encrypted at *all points*, which is technically impossible. Many people applied for an exemption from this rule in case a judge who doesn't understand chose to interpret it that way.

* Protection of integrity is a fundamental tenet of what the Internet Society needs to do.

* When we go out on the street and say "you need to encrypt!", people think of credit card fraud and maybe identity theft. But not the big picture. We have to guide this process.

* It's all about risk mitigation - not 100% protection. That's the cost of battle - we can't get rid of the risk altogether.

The open source community
-------------------------

* VM Brasseur - the business of community

* Part of the defence of the internet is engagement of stakeholders

* Are we helping or not?

* Open source - including Linux - runs most of the internet. The engine is open source.

* IoT devices run variants of Linux, including on trains, planes and automobiles.

* Majority of proprietary CPE and hardware appliances also use Linux - what's the community's relationship with those companies? There's a disconnect between people commissioning this work and people actually doing it. How do you push updates? etc

* It's not just the OS, it's the application layer too

* Systems/apps that are proprietary often depend on FOSS - e.g. routers

Perceptions of good
-------------------

* Code is open to scrutiny - you can check the code, reproducible builds to ensure integrity, and so on.

* Enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow... provided you are looking. And there are lots of examples of bugs being found.

* Community rapid disclosure of problems and delivery of solutions - more resources than in the proprietary world

* Wide peer review.

* Dirty COW kernel bug - once reported, a fix was out in hours. But we also need sysadmins deploying updates.

* The DHS Open Source Hardening Project - 50M lines of code, found 7,826 bugs that have been fixed

Seat belts
----------

* Are we still getting over seat belt syndrome? Seat belts weren't initially accepted - would they hinder escape or make you feel claustrophobic?

* The academic hippies of ARPANET

* You just need to keep the bad guys out with your firewall - we didn't think of insider attacks

* Now you can just plug a small device on the internal network - now we have to defend against that

* We need to accept that firewalls are not the be all and end all

* Security was something we all did afterwards

Perceptions of bad
------------------

* If code is exposed how can it be safe from Bad People(tm)?

* Who do you go to when things go wrong? Who's accountable? Many people have not been exposed to the open source community and how it works.

* Who sets standards and oversees review/rigour? What happens when something happens to key open source maintainers?

* Community of volunteers - how do you make establishment of a community important and worthwhile for a company?

* No financial certainty/stability

* Chaos, lacking in leadership - from the perspective of normal businesses they don't understand it. When there's a lack of leadership, you can fork!

* Myths? Yes, probably - but let's not be too complacent about this.

* Heartbleed was a wakeup call. We didn't pick up a vulnerability for years - OpenSSL had a total budget of only $2,000 a year - barely enough to cover the power bill. Almost everyone depended on them! After Heartbleed, Linux Foundation formed the Core Infrastructure Initiative and got $4m of funding. Still not a lot, but an improvement.

Is there a problem? Does it need fixing?
----------------------------------------

* No issue in terms of the technical excellent and importance of open source

* Open source world moves as fast as the experts in it

* But we need resourcing - perception that we are volunteers who do things for fun may be true to a point, but large open source projects are funded and driven like businesses. e.g. Red Hat's commercial approach. Without that, it's hard to see how many of us can be supported.

* We are heavily engaged at OSI Layer 8 - we can't ignore social and political issues. Engagement with business and users and government is vital. There is acommunity of people growing up and becoming decision makers in the market who are more understanding of these things and demanding more answers.

* IoT proliferating, huge social impact. The "digital economy" is now a thing.

* Everything's connected to the internet, and it's often built with FOSS.

* Engagement with wider stakeholders is usually vicarious - very few FOSS people directly engaged with users. If stakeholders are educated/informed there's a better chance that we can figure out where problems are.

* A system is made up of software, hardware, and humans.

* We struggle with recognition by the public - proprietary software sells. Open source doesn't. The general public has relationships directly with proprietary software companies, not with FOSS.

Experience of Internet Australia
--------------------------------

* Last 18 months has been about changing organisation from a well-meaning technical organisation to a respected body that can get attention from politicians

* Opportunities to protect, educate, inform, enable

* Security/trust/integrity best implemented with collaboration with the people you're trying to assist or protect.

* The 4 stages of corporate open source participation - consumption, participation, influencing, initiation

* Internet Australia Security SIG - several organisations and people who are interested in security. Not trying to be esoteric - going out to organisations and engaging, educating. Would like to make it a joint initiative to raise profile further and develop more resources.

Questions
---------

* You were at the keynote this morning - thoughts you presented seemed very different from this morning. A: I wasn't there!
